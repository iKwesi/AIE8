# 4-Minute Video Transcript: Introduction to LCEL and LangGraph RAG

## [0:00 - 0:30] Introduction and Overview

**[SLIDE: Title - "Building Production RAG with LangGraph"]**

"Welcome to this deep dive into building production-ready RAG systems using LangChain's LCEL and LangGraph. Today, we'll explore how to transform a simple retrieval-augmented generation pipeline into a robust, edge-case-aware system that can handle real-world scenarios.

We'll be working with the 'How People Use AI' dataset to build a RAG system that not only answers questions but also validates its responses and handles edge cases gracefully."

## [0:30 - 1:15] Understanding the Building Blocks

**[SLIDE: LCEL Components - Runnables, Chains, and Composition]**

"Let's start with the foundation. LangChain's Expression Language, or LCEL, treats everything as 'Runnables' - standardized components that can be chained together like LEGO blocks. 

Our basic RAG pipeline consists of four key Runnables:
- A **Retriever** that finds relevant documents from our vector database
- A **Prompt Template** that formats our query and context
- A **Language Model** running locally with Ollama
- An **Output Parser** that structures the response

The magic happens when we chain these together using the pipe operator: `retriever | prompt | model | parser`. This creates a seamless flow from question to answer."

## [1:15 - 2:00] From Chains to Graphs - Enter LangGraph

**[SLIDE: Simple Graph Visualization - START → retrieve → generate → END]**

"While LCEL chains are powerful, real applications need more sophisticated control flow. That's where LangGraph comes in. Instead of linear chains, we build stateful graphs with nodes and edges.

Our basic graph has a simple flow: START leads to a retrieve node, which feeds into a generate node, ending at END. The key innovation is the **State** object - a TypedDict that carries information between nodes:

```python
class State(TypedDict):
    question: str
    context: list[Document]
    response: str
```

This state acts as our application's memory, ensuring each node has access to the complete context of the conversation."

## [2:00 - 2:45] The Technical Implementation

**[SLIDE: Code walkthrough - Vector Database Setup]**

"Let's look at the technical implementation. We start by ingesting our PDF data using PyMuPDFLoader, then chunk it using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with a 750-token limit.

For embeddings, we use Ollama's embeddinggemma model with 768 dimensions, stored in a Qdrant vector database. The beauty of this setup is that everything runs locally - no external API calls required.

Our retrieve node is elegantly simple:
```python
def retrieve(state: State) -> State:
    retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(state["question"])
    return {"context": retrieved_docs}
```

The generate node chains our prompt template with the Ollama model and output parser, creating responses based on the retrieved context."

## [2:45 - 3:30] Handling Edge Cases - The Production Reality

**[SLIDE: Enhanced Graph with Conditional Routing]**

"Here's where our solution gets interesting. Basic RAG systems fail in production because they don't handle edge cases. What happens when the retriever finds no relevant context? What if the AI hallucinates despite good context?

We solved this by extending our graph with conditional routing:

**For insufficient context**, we added a validation node that calculates embedding similarity between the question and retrieved documents. If the similarity falls below our threshold, we route to a fallback response instead of generating potentially hallucinated content.

**For fact-checking**, we implemented a post-generation verification system. After generating a response, we fact-check it against the original context using another LLM call, and if accuracy is below 70%, we trigger a correction node that generates a more conservative, fact-based response."

## [3:30 - 4:00] The Power of Graph-Based Architecture

**[SLIDE: Complete Enhanced Graph Visualization]**

"The result is a sophisticated system that transforms from:
`START → retrieve → generate → END`

Into:
`START → retrieve → validate_context → [conditional routing] → generate → fact_check → [conditional routing] → finalize → END`

This graph-based approach gives us several advantages:
- **Transparency**: Users know when information is insufficient
- **Reliability**: Fact-checking reduces hallucinations
- **Modularity**: Each node has a single responsibility
- **Observability**: We can monitor and debug each step independently

The beauty of LangGraph is that it makes complex control flow readable and maintainable. You can visualize your application logic as a flowchart and implement it almost one-to-one in code.

This is how you build production-ready RAG systems that handle the messy realities of real-world data and user queries. Thank you for watching!"
